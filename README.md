# What is it ?

**three-mesh-ui** is a small library for building VR user interfaces. The objects it creates are [Three.Object3Ds](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/core/Object3D.js), usable directly in a [three.js](https://threejs.org) scene like any other Object3D.    
        
**It is not a framework**, but a minimalist library to be used with the last version of three.js. It has no dependency other than three.js.

# Why ?

In a normal three.js workflow, the common practice is to build the user interfaces with HTML/CSS.

In immersive VR, this is not possible. **The purpose of _three-mesh-ui_ is to offer a tool similar to HTML/CSS** to build genuine meshes that can be used the normal way inside a three.js scene rendered with WebGLRenderer.

# How to use

## Import
**With NPM and ES6 :**   
In your console : `npm install three-mesh-ui`
```javascript
import ThreeMeshUI from 'three-mesh-ui'
```

**With NPM and CommonJS :**   
In your console : `npm install three-mesh-ui`
```javascript
const ThreeMeshUI = require('three-mesh-ui/dist/three-mesh-ui.js');
```

**With HTML <script> tag :**    
```html
<script src='https://unpkg.com/three-mesh-ui/dist/three-mesh-ui.js'></script>
```

## Font files

In order to display some text with three-mesh-ui, you will need to provide font files.   
You can use the two files named `Roboto-msdf` in [this directory](https://github.com/felixmariotto/three-mesh-ui/tree/master/examples/assets), or [create your own font files](https://github.com/felixmariotto/three-mesh-ui/wiki/Creating-your-own-fonts)

## API

Here is an example of basic three-mesh-ui usage : 

```javascript
const container = new ThreeMeshUI.Block({
 width: 1.2,
 height: 0.7,
 padding: 0.2,
 fontFamily: './assets/Roboto-msdf.json',
 fontTexture: './assets/Roboto-msdf.png',
});

//

container.add(

 new ThreeMeshUI.Text({
  content: "Some text to be displayed"
 })
 
);

// scene is a THREE.Scene (see three.js)
scene.add( container );

// This is typically done in the loop :
ThreeMeshUI.update();
```
